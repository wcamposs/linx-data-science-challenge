# Linx Data Science Challenge

My results for the Linx Impulse Data Science challenge, offered for the job placement in Data Science during the Work Week event.

# Tools and environment used

For this challenge, I used a docker container, Jupyter notebook and the 'pandas' and 'matplotlib' libraries. However, all the components contained in the container used are specified in the 'requirements,txt' document.

# Tests

In order to avoid any unexpected errors during document correction, each issue of challenge was executed in a unique way.

Finally, the whole script was executed to ensure that no script execution error appears during the document correction.

# Documents contained

1. **data_science_challenge.ipnb**        # Codes and results for the challenge
2. **dataset_documentation.ipnb**         # Documentation of the dataset used
3. **ecommerce-events.ndjson**            # Dataset used for the challenge
4. **requirements.txt**                   # Requirements used on the Docker Container
